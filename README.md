### Tech

E-Cell uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Atom Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [MongoDB] - Non-Relational database for storage
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course E-Cell itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

E-Cell requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v7+ to run.
